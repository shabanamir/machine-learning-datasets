# El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Data
ENSO Related Standardized Monthly Climate Data (1950–2023)

### Context
ENSO is a periodic fluctuation (i.e., every 2–7 years) in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, affecting the climate of many parts of the world. It is one of the main drivers of the interannual climate variability of Earth and can cause a wide range of climate anomalies. This dataset is to store  ENSO indicators (variables related to ENSO) for better understanding and prediction of ENSO.

### Content
